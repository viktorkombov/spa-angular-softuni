# AngularSpaProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2 and is for the Angular course in SoftUni.

## Getting started

The name of this single page application is vashiterecepti.bg (your recipes).
"Your recipes" (or in Bulgarian "Вашите рецепти") is has to be a food-focused social network for cooks or just for people who loves cooking. Here everyone will play a part in helping cooks discover and share their recipes.

For now the only one language in the app is Bulgarian.

## Development server
To use this app you have to run this code from the app location:
"ng serve --open". and to download this REST API for client-server:

"https://github.com/viktorkombov/rest-api-for-angular-project"

You can start the server with this code: "npm i AND npm start"

## Home page for guests

Initially, you will see the home page for guests.
Here you have to choose to stay unlogged or to login and to have access to all contain of the application, with the functionality for login and register.

# Logged in users

The application provides to users with the functionality to view all the recipes which are in the database, to share recipes, to view recipe details page and to like recipes or to edit or delete these which are created by them.

The Web page comunicate to a remote service via REST-api client-server.

There is autentication, authorization, error handling and data validation for avoiding crashes when invalid data is entered.


## Source code

The whole client-side part of the app is made with Angular.

The code is separated to modules, components, services, pipes, directives, interfaces, interceptors.

In the code you also can see observables and Angular template and reactive forms.


I will push more info to this readme.md and also will try to deploy my project and to use file storage to get more bonus points.
